Pedram Mousavi's work is all about detail, so his vision must be sharp. The luxury auto detailing studio owner says in addition to looking at glossy reflective paints, he spends hours staring at his computer and phone screens.

That's why he became concerned when he began experiencing vision problems.

At first, he said, it just felt like he had dust in his eyes.

"There was something wrong with my eyes. They were reddish and dry, dry, dry," said the 43-year-old Toronto business owner, one of more than 10 million Canadians with evaporative dry eye disease.

Eye health experts say research now links overuse of computer and smartphone screens to several progressive, irreversible eye disorders, such as dry eye disease and myopia, at rates not seen before.

"There has been an exponential increase in screen time since the pandemic," said Dr. Rana Taji, owner and medical director of Toronto Medical Eye Associates. She is one of many eye specialists who have issued online warnings about how screen overuse is changing people's eyes.

Over time, staring too long at screens can change the structure of the eyeball and lead to atrophy of the glands that keep it moist. Research is now pointing to excessive screen time for the rise in eye disorders, such as dry eye and myopia, which are becoming more common and affect more young people.
